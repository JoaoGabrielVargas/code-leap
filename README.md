## 💻 About the project

<p>Welcome to the Code Leap Network! Code Leap is a social network of developers who, in their own applications, interact through the CodeLeap api. It's fun!. </p>
<p> The project was carried out using React, with Next Js to help create the features. To manage the global state, I used Redux. </p>
<p> In development, Eslint was used to help clean up the code. </p>
The following folder structure was used: 

```
├── src
│   ├── components
│   ├── pages
│   ├── redux
│   ├── services
│   ├── slices
│   ├── styles
│   ├── utils

```

<p>The deployment was done on Vercel, so you can use the app without having to download and run it on your port 3000! https://dev-finder-omega.vercel.app/ </p>
